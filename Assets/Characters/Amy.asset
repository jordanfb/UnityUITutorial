    you say! She introduces herself as Amy. "Nice to meet you!" You both say at once,

  events:
  - Oops! You ran into someone at the store. Good thing it's your friend Amy! You
    both laugh nervously. Amy quickly leaves the store with her suspiciously buldging
    coat. Your friendship is strengthened even more with yet another crazy collision.
  - Oops! You ran into someone at your car. Good thing it was your friend Amy! You
    both laugh nervously. She removes the slim jim from your car door and heads off
    down the street. Wow. You keep colliding with Amy! It's crazy!
  - Oops! You ran into someone at your office. Good thing it was your friend Amy.
    You both laugh nervously. Amy drops three staplers and a pack of post-it-notes
    on the ground as she leaves. What a crazy coincidence running into Amy again!
  - Oops! You ran into someone at your house. Good thing it was your friend Amy. You
    both laugh nervously. Amy takes off her ski mask and starts walking down the street,
    whistling all the way. Huh, why do you keep on colliding with Amy?
