  introductionText: 'An ominous black figure stands there, the personification of
    death itself, with his dark, coweled cloak and razer sharp scythe.


    You walk over and say hello!'
  description: He stands there, the personification of death itself, with his dark,
    coweled cloak and ominious scythe.
  spawnLocations: 01000000
  events:
  - You wander over and see the grim reaper standing over a newly deceased body. You
    thought that the scythe was used more metaphorically for harvesting but apparently
    it's quite necessary.
  - You look around and catch someone staring at you from the hospital gift shop.
    It's the grim reaper.
