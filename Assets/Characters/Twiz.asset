  introductionText: You see a rad mad lad zooming down the street on his Heelys. This
    seems like a mood dude who'd make a good addition to your clique. "What's up?"
    you ask him. "Not much. Twiz?" He offers you a Twizzler from a bag he seemingly
    pulled from nowhere. You take one. Twizzlers are yummy.
  description: I think the nickname is from the candy?

  - '"Twiz???" Your friend comes into the store, staring at his hands in confusion.
    You quickly nab a new bag of Twizzlers from the shelf nearby and stick them into
    his hands. "Twiz" he says, contentedly.'
  - '"Twiz!" Your friend skates by on his Heelys as he is wont to do. Life is good.'

    Congratulations!'
  noText: '"Yo Twiz, you want to hang out sometime?" You ask. "Dude, my name isn''t
    ''Twiz,'' it''s Jasper. I''ve told you like five times already, get it in that
    thick skull of yours." Twiz walks away in disgust.


    Better luck next time!'
